# About
>This is a new Project to create a Mobster Profile Photo Album. The project is a work in progress
>and uses React for the front-end. Later on we will implement mongoDB for the database.


## Naming conventions
- If it is a page component name it 'PageName' + Page, for example HomePage or UserPage
- If it is a component to be nested the name should be 'CompName' + Component, for example SearchComponent


### Working on the project
- During development each team will create a development branch for their project
- At the end of the project we will merge into the production/master branch


#### Teams
We will work in teams of two to create individual components. Currently Cezary & Rogier,
David & Pedro and Irina & Monica.


#### Dependancies & setup
- When you clone the project you can run 'npm install' to install any Dependancies based on the 'package.json' file. To launch the project run 'npm start'.
